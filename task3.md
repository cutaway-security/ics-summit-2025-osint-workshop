# OSINT Workshop
[Agenda](./index.md)
## Task 3: Student Targets Identification

Creating a realistic OSINT target is difficult and, in my opinion, not very realistic. Hence, conducting OSINT on a live target will be a better experiences. However, it is unfair to have the workshop focus on a single target. Therefore, we need another way.

### Student Identified Target

If you have a target in mind, you can do this workshop on that specific target. You can select your employer, a partner organization, one of your integrators, or one of your venders. 

### Randomly Identified Target

Students can also query an AI tool, such as [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/){:target="_blank"} or [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app){:target="_blank"}, to request a target by name and primary domain. The following command creates a basic array of the different industrial sectors by name. The command requests that the AI pick a sector from the array and then identifies a company, by name and primary domain, that provides products or services in that industry.

Run the following query and use the randomly identified target as the focus of your workshop's OSINT activities. If the information gathering is producing limited results then run the command again. Most targets will work and produce interestingly unique results.

The `Be succinct` statement in this query helps to prevent overly verbose responses from the AI. Remove that part if you want a bit more detail about the selection from the AI tool.

> For the industrial industries in the following list, pick one of the industries randomly and then find a company that provides products or services in that industry. Provide the name of the company and the primary website for that company. Be succinct.
