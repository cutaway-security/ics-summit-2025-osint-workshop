# SANS ICS Summit 2025 - OSINT Workshop

This project was started to support the [SANS ICS Summit 2025](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-training-events/ics-security-summit-2025/). The intent for this project is to provide some simple OSINT gathering techniques for students and assessment teams to gather information about an organization from the internet without the need for fancy tools or subscriptions. It is not a replacement for robust OSINT techniques, tools, or commercial products. This is just a methodology for fast analysis to support high level risk management programs, security assessments, and penetration testing. 

Students seeking more in-depth and detailed OSINT training can consider the [SANS Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)Courses](https://www.sans.org/osint/). Students seeking more in-depth and detailed ICS/OT training can consider the [SANS ICS Courses](https://www.sans.org/industrial-control-systems-security) courses.
