# OSINT Workshop
## Task 2: ICS / OT Passive Geolocation Reconnaissance By Sector

Review the following resources to understand geolocation resources for each sector. 

### Self-paced Questions 

* Hunt for resources in your state or country?
* Are we missing sectors?
* Can you find other mapping resources for these and other sectors?
