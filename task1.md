# OSINT Workshop
[Agenda](./index.md)
## Task 1: Workshop's OSINT Process Outline

This workshop is designed to provide an introduction to gathering publicly accessible information about an organization's control environment. We will use a combination of teaching techniques but will rely heavily on students doing OSINT lab exercises. The exercise activities will include doing manual and automated reviews of targets involved with industrial and automation control sectors. 

Each of the tasks are designed to provide an overview of a specific OSINT gathering and analysis concept. You may or may not complete the task in the time alloted during the workshop. The instructors will move the workshop along every ten minutes. This will ensure the workshop continues to progress and students perform most of the information gathering techniques. This means that some of the analysis steps and techniques may have to be worked on later on your own time.

## Workshop Objectives

Workshop attendees and students will be introduced to the following OSINT tactics, techniques, and tools during the workshop.

1. A basic OSINT information gathering process to gather, analysis, and understand OSINT data about a specific ICS / OT target.
2. Understand online resources that provide specific information, particularly location details, about different industrial sectors.
3. Understand a simple open-source tool that can automate information gathering, analysis, and reporting.
4. Manually perform information gathering and analysis to understand risk for an organization.
5. Understand how threat actors are gathering information about your company, your clients, and your people.

## Continuous Study Opportunities

You, the student, may or may not be able to complete all of these labs. The website for this workshop will remain online after the SANS ICS Summit 2025. This way you can continue to work on these labs to completion and come back to practice in the future. Now that it is online, it will also be available to your team members to do team events. Happy Hunting.
