# OSINT Workshop
[Agenda](./index.md)

## Task 4: Initial Website Review

### Target Website Review

Most organizations provide a lot of detail about their organization, services, products, and personnel on their website. A quick review may provide enough information to gain an understanding about their basic operations, plant locations, partners, other businesses, and their personnel. Conduct an initial review the target's website for interesting information and to have a better understanding of the target. Here are a few key areas to focus on.

1. Review any `About` or `Who We Are` pages to determine they type of business and industrial sector for the target.

2. Identify any geolocation references.

3. Locate any pages that list partners or investors.

4. Review the job or career pages.

5. Locate the list of executive or advisory board members. We'll go deeper into this in [Task 9](task9.md).

6. Review the website for any current news releases.

7. Does the site have a support and / or vulnerability information page?

### Geolocation Target Analysis

If you finish early, or as a part of your follow-on research, go back and use any geolocation information about your target to do the searches you performed in [Task 2](task2.md). Determine if you can find the target's headquarter's building, plants, or remote process sites (e.g. substation, pump station, compressor station).

## Next Step

When you are done, move onto [Task 5](task5.md): Start SpiderFoot Information Gathering.
