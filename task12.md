# OSINT Workshop
[Agenda](./index.md)

## Task 12: OSINT Risk Mitigations

### Building Culture Using Security Awareness Training

In today's interconnected world, Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) is a powerful force. While it has legitimate uses, adversaries also leverage publicly available information to target individuals and organizations. This workshop highlights that safeguarding our digital footprint isn't just an IT department's job. Protecting personal and company information is a cultural imperative that depends on how each of us conducts ourselves online, both personally and professionally.

Effective cybersecurity awareness training, particularly that which includes Operations Security (OPSEC) principles, is vital. By learning to identify and protect sensitive information before it becomes public, we build the "good online habits" that extend to our communities personal and professional lives. Cybersecurity awareness training isn't just about technical controls. These programs are designed to foster a culture of compliance where cybersecurity becomes a shared responsibility that affects operations and safety.

The [SANS ICS Cybersecurity Awareness Training](https://www.sans.org/security-awareness-training/products/specialized-training/ics-engineer/){:target="_blank"} program includes several security awareness modules designed for the different roles and responsibilities within ICS environments. These roles include:

* **ICS for end users** - End Users will gain a comprehensive understanding of the interdependence and interconnectedness of systems and how they can be compromised through a range of real-world examples.
* **ICS for practitioners** - By adopting a cyber engineering perspective on system operations, practitioners will further enhance their defense capabilities against attacks and improve their responses.
* **ICS for Sr. Leadership** - Leaders will learn about key aspects of employing a, ICS risk management program, including supply chain management, validating patches and files, managing breach notifications, and remote access among others through a series of targeted modules.
