# OSINT Workshop
[Agenda](./index.md)

## Task 8: Personnel Analysis

One of the key OSINT research areas is for a target company's employees. Employees are targeted by threat actor groups because they use the internet for learning and sharing, have knowledge of the target, have the permission and ability to interact with target resources, and have relationships with other companies. Enumerating a company's employees provides a list of targets for phishing campaigns, generation of user account names, generation of email addresses, and (in the worst case) potential blackmail and extortion candidates.

### Enumerate Target Website for Employees

Companies share information about their employees by documenting organizational charts, lists of executives and directors, and publishing articles. These items can be found by manually reviewing or using Google to search the target website.

For workshop purposes, limit review of target employees to first name and last name. We'll use these for considering or generating email addresses in other tasks. We'll also use this when searching online resources, such as [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

If you are tracking personnel, consider creating a spreadsheet or Comma Separated Value (CSV) document with the following fields, if available. For actual assessments you may want to collect additional information.

* First Name
* Last Name
* Title
* Company
* Domain
* Email

1. Review the target website to identify `executives` and `board of directors`.

2. Review the target website for `organization charts`.

3. Review the target website for a list of projects or teams that may identify individuals.

4. Review the target website for press releases.

5. Review the target's career page for employee attestations what might provide information about them.

6. Review PDF, MS Word, MS Excel documents for project documentation. These documents may name specific individuals such as project managers, engineers, operators, inspectors, safety teams, and other personnel specifically assigned to that project.

### LinkedIn Company Search

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/){:target="_blank"} provides a wealth of information about a company and its employees. This social media site can be searched without an account but the results are extremely limited. Searching with an account will provide additional results which will ba associated with the user's account, unless privacy settings have been set on the search user's account. 

Conduct a quick search of the [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/){:target="_blank"} site for the target company's name. Review employees to find the following ICS / OT related skill sets

* Project manager
* Document manager
* ICS equipment programmer
* ICS / OT cybersecurity team
* OT network administrator
* OT windows administrator
* Control systems engineer
* Compliance, auditing, governance
* Safety engineer
* Project engineer
