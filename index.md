# Recon for the Real World: Practical OSINT in ICS/OT Operations
## Introduction

Welcome to the [SANS ICS Summit 2025](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-training-events/ics-security-summit-2025/){:target="_blank"} OSINT Workshop. This is a two-hour event where we will walk through some [basic concepts and techniques](./abstract.md) for conducting [Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)](https://www.sans.org/osint/){:target="_blank"} analysis of targets. We are going to do this analysis **_without loading commercial tools or tools that require accounts or API keys_**. But, don't let that stop you. Follow the process using your commercial, authenticated, and custom tools to do this workshop.

## Additional Considerations

### Experienced OSINT Analysts

Some of this might be basic for you. Stick with the class or move on at your own pace. Help your neighbors. Remember the leadership axiom "Train Your Own Replacement." We, your team, and the industries are stronger when we work together. 

### Contributors

Be sure to checkout, and thank, the [Contributors](contributors.md) to this workshop.

### Tools

We use very few tools for this workshop as most of the OSINT data collection and analysis can be done using a web browser. You can track all of the tools used and referenced in this workshop on the [Tools](tools.md) page. The [AI Tool Consideration](./ai_tools.md) page provides recommendations about using AI tools during the workshop.

### Note Taking

Do not worry about taking notes during this workshop. For assessments, do make sure you are keeping accurate notes. The [Notes](notes.md) page has some of our recommendations.
