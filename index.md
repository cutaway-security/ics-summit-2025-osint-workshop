## OSINT Workshop
### Intruction

Welcome to the SANS ICS Summit 2025 OSINT Workshop. This is a two-hour event where we will walk through some basic concepts and techniques for conducting Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) analysis of targets. Stick with the class or move on at your own pace. Help your neighbors. We are going to do this analysis without loading commercial tools or tools that require accounts or API keys. But, don't let that stop you. Follow the process using your commercial, authenticated, and custom tools to do this workshop.
